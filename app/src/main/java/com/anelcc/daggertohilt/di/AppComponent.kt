/*
A @Component interface gives the information Dagger needs to generate the graph at compile-time.
The parameter of the interface methods define what classes request injection.
In Dagger2 injected class called components. These components assign references in our activity,
services, and fragments to have access to the singleton which we are already defined.
The application graph needs to know about StorageModule: because we are only accessing Module.class
via our @Component annotation we also need to add the another Module.class to the list of modules.
Eg. {Module1.class, Module2.class}

// Scope annotation that the AppComponent uses
